# Challenges 
1. Automating repetitive administrative and operational tasks in banking, follow this structured procedure:

### Step-by-Step Procedure

#### 1. **Problem Identification and Scope Definition**

- **Identify Tasks**: List all repetitive tasks in the banking operation (e.g., data entry, document verification, transaction processing).
- **Define Scope**: Determine which tasks can be feasibly automated given time and resource constraints.

#### 2. **Data Collection and Preparation**

- **Gather Data**: Collect banking data for AI training and historical records for blockchain.
- **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for training AI models. This includes handling missing values, normalizing data, and ensuring consistent formatting.

#### 4. **Model Development and Training**

1. **Choose AI Models**:
   - **OCR Models**: For document processing and data extraction.
   - **NLP Models**: For text generation and understanding customer inquiries.
   - **Machine Learning Models**: For predictive analytics and task automation.

2. **Train Models**:
   - Use the prepared data to train the AI models.
   - Fine-tune the models to ensure accuracy and reliability in specific banking tasks.

3. **Validate Models**:
   - Test the models using a validation set to ensure they perform well on unseen data.
   - Adjust hyperparameters and retrain if necessary.

4. **Develop APIs**:
   - Create APIs to integrate AI models with existing banking systems.
   - Ensure secure and efficient data transfer between components.
   - Deploy models via REST APIs or as microservices.

#### 5. **Blockchain Network Setup**

1. **Deploy Nodes**:
   - Set up blockchain nodes for a secure network.
     
2. **Smart Contracts**:
   - Develop smart contracts for transactions, verification logs, and audit trails.

#### 6. **Integrate AI and Blockchain**

- **API Development**: Backend Logic: Implement backend logic to handle API requests and integrate AI models.
                       Blockchain Interaction: Use Web3.js or similar tools to interact with the blockchain.
- **Secure Data Handling**: Ensure data sent to and from AI models is logged on the blockchain securely..

#### 7. **Develop Frontend Interfaces**

2. **User Interaction**:
   - Create interfaces for document upload, verification status, and transaction history.

3. **Real-Time Updates**:
   - Show real-time updates using web sockets or polling for blockchain transactions.
   - Focus on usability and accessibility.

#### 8. **Testing and Quality Assurance**

- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components (AI models, smart contracts).
- **Integration Testing**: Test the complete workflow from data input to blockchain logging.
- **User Testing** : Collect feedback from real users to refine the interface and workflow.
- 
#### 9. **Deployment and Monitoring**
- **Deploy**: Deploy the AI models, backend server, blockchain nodes, and frontend application.
- **Monitor**: Set up monitoring for AI model performance and blockchain transaction health.
- **Maintenance**: Regularly update AI models and smart contracts to improve accuracy and security.

#### Benefits of Combining AI and Blockchain
Enhanced Security: Immutable records on the blockchain ensure data integrity.
Improved Efficiency: AI automates routine tasks, reducing processing time and errors.
Transparency and Trust: Blockchain provides a transparent audit trail for all operations.
