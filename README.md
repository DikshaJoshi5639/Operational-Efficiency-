## Objective
The objective of this project is to enhance the operational efficiency of banking processes through the integration of generative AI. By automating routine tasks and optimizing workflows, we aim to reduce processing time, minimize errors, optimize resource allocation, provide intelligent insights for process improvements and decision-making support additionally, we implement high-security measures using advanced blockchain techniques, specifically Ethereum, to ensure maximum protection.
## Challenges
- Automate repetitive administrative and operational tasks in banking.
- Optimize resource allocation and workflow management for improved efficiency.
- Provide intelligent insights to support process improvements and decision-making.

## Project Components
### 1. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
- Implemented text processing techniques (tokenization, TF-IDF vectorization) and numerical feature engineering (e.g., age, balance) to prepare data for machine learning models.

### 2. Machine Learning Model Development
- Developed machine learning models to automate tasks such as predicting customer behavior and optimizing campaign strategies.

### 3. Chatbot Development
- Created a responsive chatbot interface using NLP and integrated it with AI models to interact with users, answer queries, and provide personalized recommendations.

### 4. Security Implementation
- Implemented blockchain and cryptography technologies to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data produced by AI models, ensuring data privacy and security.

## File Structure
- `/data`: Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- `/models`: Stores trained machine learning models.
- `/scripts`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and chatbot development.
- `/docs`: Documentation files, including project requirements, setup instructions, and user guides.
